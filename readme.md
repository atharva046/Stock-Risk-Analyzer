- **Historical Stock Movement Analysis**: Visualizes past stock performance with detailed graphs.
- **Stock Risk Assessment**: Assesses potential risks and suggests insights for investment decisions.
- **Real-time Stock News and Market Data**: Fetches news and tender/contract information related to stocks.
- **Authentic Data Sources**: Pulls data from trusted sources such as BSE, NSE, NSDL, CDSL.
- **API Integration**: Utilizes free APIs for stock charts (e.g., Kite or Upstox) and real-time updates.
- **Future Price Predictions**: Uses machine learning models to predict stock price movements.
